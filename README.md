# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Restaurant-Reviews
- The goal of this project is to create a prediction model that can foretell whether a review of the restaurant will be favorable or unfavorable.
- We'll use the Restaurant Review dataset to accomplish this and load it into the multinomial naive bayes, bernoulli naive bayes, and logistic regression predictive algorithms. 
- It uses natural language processing and machine learning techniques to build a sentiment analysis model for restaurant reviews. 
- It preprocesses the text, extracts features, trains a classifier, and evaluates its performance.
- Finally, it can be used to predict the sentiment of new reviews...
