# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Restaurant-Reviews
The goal of this project is to create a prediction model that can foretell whether a review of the restaurant will be favorable or unfavorable, We'll use the Restaurant Review dataset to accomplish this and load it into the
multinomial naive bayes, bernoulli naive bayes, and logistic regression predictive algorithms. In the end, our goal is to identify the "best" model for analysing the sentiment of reviews.
